  # NACHA (the regulatory body governing the ACH network) requires that API
  # callers (merchants, partners) obtain the consumer’s explicit authorization
  # before initiating a transaction. To stay compliant, you’ll need to make sure
  # that you retain a compliant authorization for each transaction that you
  # originate to the ACH Network using this API. ACH transactions are
  # categorized (using SEC codes) by how you capture authorization from the
  # Receiver (the person whose bank account is being debited or credited).
  # PayPal supports the following SEC codes.
